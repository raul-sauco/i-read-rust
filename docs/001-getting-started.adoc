= 1. Getting started

Since the frontend depends on the backend to get data, we will get started with the latter, use Cargo to create a new Rust project.

[source,sh]
----
$ cargo new backend --vcs none
----

NOTE: We use the `--vcs none` flag because we are planning on having both the backend and the frontend under a parent Git directory.

Then we can check that everything works running:

[source,sh]
----
$ cargo run
> Hello World!
----

Cargo set the project for us and it already compiles and runs.
